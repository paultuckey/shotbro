Sick of out of date screenshots in support sites and websites.  

Generate them automatically using PlayWright and Shot Bro!

## Getting Started

### Already use Playwright?

```bash
npm install shotbro
```

Add to your gitignore:
```gitignore
.shotbro/
```

Get a key and add it to a `.env` file
```bash
SHOTBRO_API_KEY=keyGoesHere
```


# How does it work

during your test run calling `shotbroPlaywright` will save full page shot and html with positional info to disk.

When `shotbro` cli is called this will upload the generated shots annotation info ready for processing
