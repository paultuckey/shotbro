# Design Considerations

 - Don't get "in front" of other tools.  We should be "beside" them so.
   - Because: the end user can use full features of other tools without this tool getting in the say 
 - Tool should work in as many environments as possible (OS, Node versions etc)
   - Because: we don't want to be annoying.  It should "just work".
